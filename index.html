        <p><em>Product Designer at <a href="https://underbelly.is/">Underbelly.</a></em></p>
        <p>Greetings everyone! My name is Martin, sushi lover from San Diego, California. I’ve dove into many career paths before finding my way into Product Design; including nutrition education, physical therapy, and business consulting. My introduction to the UX world came in 2016 when I co-founded a mobile business resource center in Los Angeles. I didn’t know where to start so I Googled everything I could about crafting beautiful user experiences.
      What excites me the most about working with the Underbelly team is the diversity and autonomy we have on our projects.  We can make a huge impact on a company while still not giving up who we are as individuals, and that speaks volumes about the culture we have here. I also love that we have such an active pulse on the Salt Lake City  community, and actively work to create events and bring people together.
      When I’m not designing, I like to stay pretty active outdoors! My go-to activities are Brazilian jiu-jitsu and trail running. Another interesting (and useless) fact about me: I can recite the alphabet backwards in under 5 seconds.</p>
